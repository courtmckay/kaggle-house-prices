# Summary

This is my first attempt at completing a Kaggle competition. I'm using the Getting Started competition titled "Housing Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques". 

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.
